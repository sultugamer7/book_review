This is my Project 1
This project is used to rate and review a book!
The user needs to register for an account (register.html).
For registering, the user needs to provide a unique username and password and comfirm the password.
After registering for an account the user can log in to his/her account anytime (login.html).
After logging in the user can search for any of the books that he/she wants to search (search.html).
The search results will be displayed after a search request.
The user can click on the title of the book for getting its detailed information such as title, author, ratings, reviews, etc. (book.html).
The user can rate and review the book and also checkout the ratings and reviews made by other users on a particular book.
If a user makes a GET request to website’s /api/<isbn> route, where <isbn> is an ISBN number, then the website returns a JSON response containing the book’s title, author, publication date, ISBN number, review count, and average score.
The user can log out of his account by clicking on Log Out.
